## ðŸ¤– How AI Helped in Development

1. I utilized AI to effectively deconstruct complex project requirements into manageable modules, including CSV parsing, ClickHouse integration, and seamless frontend-backend communication. This approach allowed for a well-structured and efficient development process.

2. To gain a deeper understanding of JDBCâ€™s interaction with ClickHouse and best practices for securely handling large file uploads in Spring Boot, I consulted AI for expert insights, which ultimately helped me configure the backend optimally.

3. AI played a key role in enhancing the structure of my HTML, CSS, and JavaScript code and improving API error handling. By focusing on user experience and code maintainability, I was able to develop a more robust and scalable frontend.

4. With AIâ€™s assistance, I streamlined the data import/export process by designing an intuitive sequence, such as previewing data before execution, which was further validated by peers for usability.

5. For advanced features like auto-table creation and secure large file uploads, AI helped me cross-check best practices and ensure that edge cases and security vulnerabilities were fully addressed.

6. While I personally crafted the core README, AI assisted in refining the language, enhancing clarity, and ensuring the documentation was comprehensive and approachable for users at all levels.

> Note: The frontend and backend were implemented in a unified structure using plain HTML, CSS, and JavaScript without separate folders.
